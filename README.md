# The People's Insight :newspaper:
#### News app that gets the day's articles from top news subreddits.  Utilizes Reddit's RESTful API to get JSON data from subreddits and displays in a nice little newspaper style.



Incorporates persistent data across sessions via localStorage.  It also pulls live data from different subreddits I like to frequent.  So now I can just go here for the quick hot takes.

##### Controls:
 - type in anything to the name field, it isn't saved anywhere but your browser.
 - whenever you add a subreddit in the other text box, ex) news , it'll render it to the page,
 - to save whatever changes you make, click the load/save button with your desired ID still in the textfield.
 - to clear or change data: must enter ID and click clear button.
