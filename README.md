# The People's Insight :newspaper:
#### News app that gets the day's articles from top news subreddits.  Utilizes Reddit's RESTful API to get JSON data from subreddits and displays in a nice little newspaper style.

&emsp;&emsp;Incorporates persistent data across sessions via localStorage.  It also pulls live news data from different subreddits I think are valuable.  So now I can just go here for the quick hot takes instead of wasting 2 hours scrolling.  Apologies if there's any profanity in the top comment... working on incorporating a filter just in case, but top comments are usually not profane on these subreddits.

##### Controls:
 - whenever you add a subreddit in the other text box, ex) news , it'll render it to the page,
 - to save whatever changes you make, click the load/save button.
 - to clear or change data: click clear button, and re-submit choices.

 - Now; refresh the page, hit load --> it will load your prior subreddit submissions!
